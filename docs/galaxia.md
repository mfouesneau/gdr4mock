# Galaxia installation

[Galaxia](https://galaxia.sourceforge.net) is a c++ code to generate synthetic surveys of the Milky Way.
It offers either use of an analytic or an N-body model.

Galaxia implements the Besancon analytical model of the galaxy.
For the stellar halo, one has the additional option of using N-body simulations of Bullock and Johnston in which the halo is build up purely by accretion of satellite galaxies.

The program has been compiled and tested using GNU C++ compiler on both Linux and Mac OS X.
